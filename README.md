project motivations:
Nowadays, there are many painful cases of heart attacks, and a heart attack is an injury to one of the arteries that sends blood and oxygen to the heart. Plaques that contain this build up over time, leading to the formation of plaques in the arteries of the heart. If one of the plaques ruptures, a blood clot may form. This clot can block the arteries, leading to a heart attack. During a heart attack, the heart muscle dies due to lack of blood flow. This is very serious and something that has to be solved is why we are talking about this health issue.
