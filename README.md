# Heart Attack Prediction 
project IT326


# project motivations
Nowadays, there are many cases of heart attacks, which are blockages in the arteries. This is a very serious issue, and to solve this problem, we must know the number of infected people, their age groups, the causes, and a lot of information about them. Knowing this information takes a lot of time and may be inaccurate, so we decided to choose this topic to reduce this is the problem.

# our goal 
The goal of this data mining project is to develop an accurate predictive model for identifying individuals at risk of experiencing a heart attack. Through the analysis of relevant medical data, including demographic information, lifestyle factors, medical history, and biomarkers, the project aims to create a predictive algorithm capable of accurately assessing the likelihood of a heart attack occurrence within a specified time frame. The ultimate objective is to assist healthcare professionals in implementing proactive interventions and personalized preventive measures to mitigate the risk of heart attacks and improve patient outcomes.
