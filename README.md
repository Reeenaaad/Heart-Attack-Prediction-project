project motivations:Nowadays, there are many cases of heart attacks, which are blockages in the arteries. This is a very serious issue, and to solve this problem, we must know the number of infected people, their age groups, the causes, and a lot of information about them. Knowing this information takes a lot of time and may be inaccurate, so we decided to choose this topic to reduce this is the problem.

Goal: Conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of heart attack prediction models to identify the most effective predictors and develop a robust statistical model that accurately predicts the risk of heart attacks in a given population.
